# RoomLang ALPHA
--------------------------------
All project items relating to "RoomLang", a baseline for creating flexible rooms for various different game types. The main focus of "RoomLang" is to be easily usable and flexible, so users can harness it as they wish to make more specific modules.

Hopefully, "RoomLang" will be a nice stepping stone from graphical editors for game design.

--------------------------------
__RoomLang__

_RoomLang is a very lightweight system to handle using basic rooms with only a size (heightxwidth) and doors to other rooms. This module also contains "RoomLoader" and "RoomSaver" which will handle importing and exporting room files._

A dictionary should be used to store the list of rooms made/imported, as this will allow your program to use included functionality as intended.

--------------------------------
__Future Development__

- Give the rooms additional attributes (names, extra text)
- Possibly add items etc
- Add config file to enable greater customisation?
