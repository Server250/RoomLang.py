# RoomLang ALPHA
--------------------------------
All project items relating to "RoomLang", a baseline for creating flexible rooms for various different game types. The main focus of "RoomLang" is to be easily usable and flexible, so users can harness it as they wish to make more specific modules.

Hopefully, "RoomLang" will be a nice stepping stone from graphical editors for game design.
